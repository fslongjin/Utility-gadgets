# HEIF2JPG

Languages: English

Python version: >=3.5

A tool which can convert heif to jpg.

Hint: This program cannot work properly on Windows because these packages don't support: pyheif, whatimage



**It seems that some images cannot be converted properly when you are using some old version of PIL. So, don't forget to upgrade your PIL to the latest version!**

## Usage

1. Install all packages listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
2. Run the script, input the path of the folder, then this tool will output JPG files to cwd/convert_output
